# Github-Copilot-Project
This is a project (currently a Junior Seminar, potentially a Senior Thesis) I'm working on about Github Copilot and about how it will effect the teaching/learning environment.

# The Idea
The project started out as an idea proposed by [Luke Lafreniere](https://twitter.com/luke_lafr) from LTT in their [July 16 WAN Show](https://youtu.be/60NGxX7m1Mw?t=2308).

While Luke and Linus were discussing Github's new tool [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), Luke mentions that he'd like to see how Copilot does when graded compared to students. How does Copilot compare to students on different levels of classes?

While discussing this with some friends, it seems that it would be good to compare Copilot with:
- Students taking the class
- Internet sources
  - Credible sources like StackOverflow
  - Uncredible sources like Reddit

# The Project

Right now, this project is under active development. By the end of the semester, I need to have a 4-5 page paper on the topic. My current outline seems to be for a much bigger project than the Junior Seminar, so I'll probably have to cut it down for this semester. I'll probably store the extra content I produce here for when I do my Thesis.

Current progress: working on my [Outline](Outline.md)
