# Abstract/Intro

AI has been developing rapidly throughout the recent years. The release of GPT-3 has shown a remarkable development in AI text generation as compared to **the past**. In 2021, Microsoft introduced their new tool [Github Copilot](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/), an AI trained on publicly available code from Github, to generate code suggestions for developers. As this and similar tools become more and more prevalent, teachers and those in the academic field will need to prepare themselves as students begin to take advantage of these tools. When professors give their students assignments, if they are dishonest, students can already search the internet and plagiarize code from sources like StackOverflow. The problem with this approach is that the code is often copied verbatim, which means that professors can create their own programs to determine if a student's code is found online. There are other methods students can use to avoid coding themselves, but Github Copilot and similar tools will end up being more viable options for them.

**This brings up the important question: is using tools like Github Copilot cheating?**
