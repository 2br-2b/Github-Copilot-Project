# Further Study

In the next year or so, I am planning a much larger experiment based on Copilot's capabilities with the goal of determining whether Copilot's submissions are distinguishable from a regular student's submission. While I am still hashing out an exact methodology on [Github](https://github.com/2br-2b/Github-Copilot-Project/blob/master/Methodology.md), the result will end with having professors grade one extra assignment each. The submission will be either generated by AI or taken from the internet. As it will be a blind study, professors will not be told the source of their assignment and will be asked to grade the code along with student submissions. They will then take the grade, compare it to other students' grades, and see if Copilot does better, worse, or average in their class. I am still working on the exact details, but if you are interested in helping with this process, please contact me via the email listed on [my Github profile](https://github.com/2br-2b) and let me know! Thank you for your interest in my project!
